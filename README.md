## 🎮 Gameplay

Drop each block onto the one below. The overlapping part is what you keep — the rest falls off. Miss completely and it's game over.

- **Perfect landing** — block grows back and you earn streak points
- **3 perfects in a row** — streak starts, gems start dropping
- **Speed increases** as your tower grows, then plateaus at a humanly possible cap
